The XdomNetwork unit implements the TIndyResourceResolver component, a TStandardResourceResolver descendant which allows to resolve a network resource via an HTTP connection into a memory stream.  It works just the same way as TStandardResourceResolver, but accepts in addition to file scheme URLs also http scheme URLs.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

The XDOM_network unit needs Internet Direct 10 (Indy), which is available at "http://www.nevrona.com/indy/", to be installed on you Delphi system.
