= HOW TO UPGRADE FROM OLDER VERSIONS TO XDOM 4.1 =
==================================================


How to update your old Delphi code
----------------------------------

You can use other XDOM major versions (such as 3.1 
or 3.2) together with version 4.1, but only one of 
these packages can be an active design package.  In
other words: you cannot mix visual components from 
different XDOM versions in the same project.  
However, you can use multiple XDOM versions in the 
same unit at runtime.  To do so, add the XDOM units 
you want to use to the uses clause of your unit.  
Now, you can use the name of the XDOM units as a 
prefix to refer to the correct class unambiguously, 
e.g. Xdom_3_1.TdomDocument vs. Xdom_4_1.TdomDocument.

In case you want to completely update all your 
Delphi projects to Xdom 4.1 proceed as follows:

1. First you must uninstall the old components as 
   described below.
2. Install XDOM 4.1 as described in the README.txt 
   file.
3. Reload your projects and remove each reference
   to an earlier XDOM version in the uses clauses 
   of a unit and replace it by a reference to 
   Xdom_4_1, if that is not done automatically by 
   the Delphi shell.
4. Adjust your source code. For a detailed 
   documentation of all classes see the 'manual.xml'
   file in the 'manual' folder.
   

Important differences to XDOM 3.2.2
-----------------------------------

- In the TXmlSimpleInputSource, TXmlInputSource, and
  TXmlDoctypeDeclTokenizer classes' constructors the 
  InitialRegularCharsInLine parameter has been 
  replaced with the InitialCharsInLine parameter. 
  The old parameter excluded TABs whereas the new 
  includes them.

For other changes in particular XDOM classes and
methods see the HISTORY.txt file.


How to completely uninstall old XDOM components
-----------------------------------------------

1. Choose "Component | Install Packages". 
   A new dialog is launched.
2. Uninstall the old XDOM package by using the 
   Remove button.
3. Close the package window, and next confirm
   that the modifications should be saved. 
4. Delete all old XDOM files (make a backup 
   before, if required).
