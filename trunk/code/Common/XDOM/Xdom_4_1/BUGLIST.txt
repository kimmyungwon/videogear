=====================================================

1. KNOWN BUGS AND OPEN ISSUES
=============================
* Open issues are indicated in the source code as 
  'TODO' notes.


2. RARELY TESTED FEATURES
=========================
The following XDOM features need more testing.  Use
them with care:
* TXmlToDomParser.ParseWithContext.
* Document mutation events.
* Repositioning of a TdomNodeIterator object after
  document mutation.


3. TO DO LIST
=============
* Write some more sample applications.
* TXmlNamespaceSignalGenerator: Add namespace 
  validation.
* Support for XML 1.1.
* Implement an optional test for non-deterministic 
  content models (cf. XML 1.0, App. E).
* TXmlToDomParser: Implement special parsing options,
  such as directly building a namespace aware object
  model or automatic stripping of whitespace in 
  element content, etc.
* Implement asynchronous parsing.
* Add schema validation.
* Add a Suspend flag to the TXmlDocBuilder class.
* Improve formatted output.
* Optimize XPath evaluation speed.
* Improve ISO-639 / RFC 3066 support.
* Review the code for private methods to be moved
  to protected.
